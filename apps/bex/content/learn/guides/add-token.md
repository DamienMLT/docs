# Add Token Metadata

Token metadata is maintained on a Berachain token list.
This list is used to update formation such as:

- Token Logo
- Coingecko ID
- Price Feeds
- Tags

A team may submit a pull request to the [Metadata](https://github.com/berachain/metadata/tree/main) repository to update these values.
dApps utilizing the token list, such as BEX, will be able to show your token's information and logo.
