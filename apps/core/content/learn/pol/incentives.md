# Incentive Marketplace

Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) enables protocols to entice validator's to direct their `$BGT` emissions to a protocol's Reward Vault using whitelisted Incentive tokens. In doing so, protocols attract users to their protocol with `$BGT` rewards.

## How Incentives Work

### Incentive Users

As an overview, Incentives involve 3 different parties:

| User      | Description & Motiviation                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Booster   | Any user that boosts a validator with $BGT for the purpose of increasing a Validator's $BGT emissions to capture move Incentives from Reward Vaults, so that the Booster can take a portion of those Incentives.                               |
| Validator | A node in the Active Set that directs $BGT emissions to different Reward Vaults defined by their Reward Allocaton distribution, captures Incentives from Reward Vaults, and takes a percentation (Commission Rate) of the Incentives captured. |
| Protocol  | An entity, group, or organization that offers Incentive tokens for their respective Reward Vault with the goal of capturing $BGT emissions for their protocol and/or users.                                                                    |

### Incentive Distribution Flow

## Incentive Mechanics

### Whitelisting Incentive Tokens

- Whitelising incentive tokens involves using governance 

### Incentive Token Managers

- Only Incentive Token Managers of a Reward vault can offer incentives
- There can be 1 incentive manager per token, or all the same
- Changing an incentive token manager involves governance

### Offering Incentives

- How many WL tokens (3)
- Can only increase, no take backs
- Reset when fully fulfilled

### Validator Incentive Tokens Commission

- A validator can set their own commission with a delay of 16,... blocks before they can queue and active a new commission rate
- Rate of distribution (right away)
- Higher BGT Boost = larger amount of Incentives received related to BGT Emissions

### Booster Incentive Token Rewards

- Who is a booster
- Rate of distribution of rewards
