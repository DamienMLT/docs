# Incentive Marketplace

Proof of Liquidity (PoL) enables protocols to bid for validator emissions using whitelisted incentive tokens. In doing so, protocols attract users to their protocol with `$BGT` rewards.

Validators can direct emissions to protocols' pools through reward vaults, collecting these incentives in return. Validators are expected to redistribute received incentives to their `$BGT` delegators.

## Incentive Marketplace Operations

### Incentive Management

Token managers are the only ones entitled to add incentive tokens and control incentive parameters:

- Set incentive rate (p)
- Example: Setting rate p=10 means:
  - 10 protocol tokens exchanged per 1 BGT
  - 1000 incentive tokens deposited enables 100 BGT worth of emissions flowing to vault

### Rate Adjustments

Rate modifications follow these rules:

1. Empty vault:
   Can update to any rate
   $$r \geq r_{min}$$

2. Non-empty vault:
   Can only increase rate
   $$p^* > p$$
   Cannot decrease rate until vault incentives deplete (reverting to scenario #1)

### Distribution Flow

1. Validator emits BGT to protocol vault
2. Validator receives (p Ã— BGT) protocol tokens
3. Validator expected to share portion with delegates
4. Creates alignment between validators, protocols, and users
