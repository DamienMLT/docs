# Proof of Liquidity Updates

## January 2025

We launched Proof of Liquidity 1.0 with public release of the [Honey Paper](https://honeypaper.berachain.com/) and Berachain Mainnet.

## April 2025

**Proof of Liquidity 1.1:**   Reward Allocations limit any one reward vault to 30% share of emissions.

**Proof of Liquidity 1.2:**
1. New Maximum of 3 incentives per reward vault
2. Block Reward Emissions reduced by 20% to keep inflation below target
3. Auto-Incentivizer: fees from foundation vaults will use the fees to automatically offer incentives
