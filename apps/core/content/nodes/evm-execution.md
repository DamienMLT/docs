# EVM Execution Layer ‚ü†

The execution layer consists of multiple implementations in the form of EVM execution clients. These clients handle transactions, transaction gossiping, state management, and support for the Ethereum Virtual Machine - they are not responsible for block building.

The following execution clients have been tested and verified by BeaconKit:

| Client                                                    | Language | Sync Strategies                      | State Pruning   | Recommended Version |
