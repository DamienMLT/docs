# Support for Validator Operators ðŸ“ž

1. **Dedicated Discord channel for validator operators.**
Mainnet validators can get a dedicated support channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/berachain): `#val-yourvalidator`.
   
   To get one set up, have everyone join, then ping @mods from #node-support. 
2. The above will also get you access to `#mainnet-announce` where we announce new releases and important updates.
3. Follow Beacon-Kit releases by clicking *Watch* on [the Beacon-Kit GitHub repository](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit)
4. Biweekly office hours are held every other Tuesday on Discord voice-chat. These are announced on `#node-support` and `#mainnet-announce`.
5. If all else fails, email us at <a href="mailto:valrel@berachain.com">valrel@berachain.com</a>.
