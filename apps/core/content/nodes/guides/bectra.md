# Bectra Hardfork

Bectra is Berachain's EVM Pectra upgrade, which introduces a variety of changes, including major updates:

1. Validators can withdraw all or part of their `$BERA` stake.
2. All users can take advantage of [EIP 7702](/developers/guides/eip7702-basics) which enables any EOA to set its code based on any existing smart contract.
3. There are [additional EIPs enabled]/beacon-kit/changelog#v1-2-0-bectra-hardfork-bera-prague-electra) with this fork.

:::warning
All users, whether hosting an RPC or running a validator, **must upgrade** their Execution Client and Consensus Client to continue following the chain.

| Reth       | [1.3.12](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v1.3.12)                                                                               |
| Nethermind | [1.31.x](https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/releases/tag/1.31.11)                                                                       |

| Erigon     | [3.0.x](https://github.com/erigontech/erigon/releases/tag/v3.0.3)                                                                                |

### Step 1 - Deploy Genesis File

Use the updated execution client [genesis files](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit/tree/v1.2.0/testing/networks/80094) to ensure your node is compatible with Bectra, and place them in their respective locations based on the execution client you are using:

#### Reth, Geth, Besu, Erigon

```bash-vue{4,5}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berachain/beacon-kit/refs/tags/v1.2.0/testing/networks/80094/eth-genesis.json;
md5 eth-genesis.json;

# [Expected Exact Output]:
# 77bc26d81f1c8c16070d3b641428901f

cp eth-genesis.json var/reth/genesis.json
```

The reth, besu, Erigon, and Nethermind clients automatically load and apply the new genesis file.

##### Geth Additional Steps

For `geth` you must run `geth init` again after the genesis file has been placed in the correct directory. We recommend this be made a permanent part of every geth startup. Our recommended [startup process](https://github.com/berachain/guides/tree/main/apps/node-scripts/run-geth.sh) now includes this.

:::tip
If your node is an archive node and ordinarily runs with `--state.scheme hash`, then you must provide that option to `geth init` as well.
:::

```bash
geth init --datadir /path/to/geth/data /path/to/eth-genesis.json;
```

The geth `datadir` should contain the following directories:

```bash-vue{4-8}
tree datadir;

# [Expected Output]:
# datadir
# ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ keystore
# ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ geth
#     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ blobpool
#     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ chaindata
```

_**Example Successful Geth Bectra Upgrade:**_

```

Note: `hash=d57819..fcfb38` must be seen!

#### Nethermind

```bash-vue{4,5}
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berachain/beacon-kit/refs/tags/v1.2.0/testing/networks/80094/eth-nether-genesis.json;
md5 eth-nether-genesis.json;

# [Expected Exact Output]:
# 2deeecfe9ac40d6a8cced45cca3bf0bc
```

### Step 2 - Verify EL Upgrade

Start the execution client and check the logs for indications of successful fork activation.

```bash{5}
# [ EXAMPLE for geth - expected similar output for other EL]
# Post-Merge hard forks (timestamp based):
# - Shanghai:                    @0
# - Cancun:                      @0
# - Prague:                      @1749056400
```

## Beacon Kit Upgrade

[Beacon Kit 1.2.0](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit/releases/tag/v1.2.0) is required in addition to the [execution client configuration](#execution-client-upgrade-instructions) for the Bectra Hardfork.

### Step 1 - Configure app.toml

Revise your app.toml by adding this configuration to the `beacon-kit` section. Create the section if it doesn't exist:

**File:** `./.beacond/config/app.toml`

```toml
[beacon-kit]

chain-spec = "mainnet"     # or testnet, as case may be
```

### Step 2 - Verify CL Upgrade

Start `beacond` and verify that the following is logged. Note the **"Electra Fork Time"** in the banner.

```bash-vue{10}
./beacond start; # Use --home as needed;

# [Expected Output]:
